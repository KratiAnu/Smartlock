# Smartlock
A smart lock was built which can be opened or closed using an app. The communication between the app and the lock occurs with the help of a bluetooth module.
A servo motor is connected with the door latch. 
The rotation of the servo in degrees is controlled through the application.
The smart lock solves the problem of using locks in the doors.
One just needs to open and close the door with the application built for it.
